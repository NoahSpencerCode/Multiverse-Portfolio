My name is Noah, I am 24 years old, born and raised in Phoenix AZ. I discovered programming when I was 12 years old, and it become my favorite past time ever since. Without the means or opportunity to get a college degree I stumbled upon the Multiverse program as a new route to turn my passion into a career.
