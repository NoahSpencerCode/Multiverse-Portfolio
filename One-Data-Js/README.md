## Competencies
### JF 3.4

- Can create a logical and maintainable codebase.
- In the One-Data-Js backend app, I organized the codebase into modular components and followed best practices for maintainability and scalability.
- I created separate modules for different functionalities, such as authentication, authorization, and data handling, which allowed for easier code maintenance and updates.
- The result was a clean and well-structured codebase that facilitated collaboration among team members and streamlined the development process.

### JF 2.7

- Effectively manages state for complex User Interfaces.
- Though the application is a backend system, I also collaborated with front-end developers to ensure seamless integration of the user interface with the backend functionalities.
- I provided clear and well-documented API specifications, enabling the front-end team to effectively manage state and interact with the backend services.
- As a result, the development process was smoother, and the application's user interface was able to interact seamlessly with the backend services.

### JF 6.1

- Knows how best to communicate using different communication methods and how to adapt appropriately to different audiences.
- During the development of the One-Data-Js backend app, I actively engaged with both technical and non-technical stakeholders to gather requirements and provide updates on the progress of the project.
- I used clear and concise communication to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, ensuring a shared understanding of the project's objectives and outcomes.
- This effective communication fostered collaboration and alignment among team members and stakeholders, leading to the successful delivery of the application.
